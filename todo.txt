Global array solving?
    I can always make it one file and change ID? How do I do this in python



Done:
    -Registration for event -> donish
    -comments -> donish
    -reviewer register -> checks for user
    -All "dynamic" pages have been converted into .cgi files.
    -

Needs work:
    -reviewer login
    -admin login
        -Logins will eventually need to compare a login status
        -Will need to save login status and person logged into a variable, global
        -passing post values
        -on page entrance
            If global login variable available
                -State user name
                -also suggest logging out, on click
                    -changes variable
                    -refreshes page
        -Loggin in
            -Need to figure out how to do post on the same page
            -check if user name exists -> basically registration logic used in reverse
                if the array is empty -> there is no user name by that name
                if the array has something -> compare password
            -select row w user name then compare password
            -store data to variable
            -redirect to own page
                -Apparently I can only do redirects before the header of a page
                -Kind of ruins the whole idea honestly
                -The only other way to do a redirect would be to login from html
                then send the response on the cgi response. Since this would be a lot of work
                when it comes to paths, I should just make other cgi pages
                -How is there no simple refresh function?
            -If I don't redirect to own page, I'm gonna have to use the html equivelant
                Only issue is I lose the premature checking for login on the login page
                Whole page is setup like it doesn't expect to have redirects, at least thats
                what the html looks like.
                I guess click to redirect?
                
                
        **I'm still going need to use global variables even if I don't have a redirect**
        **I'm still going to need to check variables before a page starts for some pages**
        
        **Big question is:
            if I can't redirect pages and the user fills out a form on a cgi
            how will I change text to let them know something happened?
            I would probably have to make another cgi page and link them.
            I won't change all the path names
            I can make it cgi result, and then move all the logic there
            
                    
        -post on the same page?
        -Php equivelants
            
        
    -Scripts need redirects?
    -Admin DB page
    -reviewer upload and view upload
        -Needs store locally
        -Needs to store a reference to where items are stored locally
    -need to strip html and sql code from all forms
    -Anything that uses a global variable needs to be written into a script.
        -Means
            -reviewer login
            -admin login
            -admin db
            -reviewer upload and view upload
        -maybe make them all forms and the link into a button without
        styling? I did it with the cancel button and in the original
        Question is if I am going need to to type all that html or if there is a
        shorter way to do it.
        
        -Also comes to the question of it is no problem sending post requests from within the site that I am on.
        
    
    
-HCI, maybe relay this to the original front end only version:
    -Perhaps regular container for larger settings
    and make fixed container for mobile., or at least just for forms.
    
    -....eh, doesn't make a big difference
    
    forms get really big
