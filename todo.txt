Done:
    -Registration for event -> donish
    -comments -> donish
    -reviewer register -> checks for user


Needs work:
    -reviewer login
    -admin login
        -Logins will eventually need to compare a login status
        -Will need to save login status and person logged into a variable
        -passing post values and changing what is there.
    -Scripts need redirects?
    -Admin DB page
    -reviewer upload and view upload
    -need to strip html and sql code from all forms
    -Anything that uses a global variable needs to be written into a script.
        -Means
            -reviewer login
            -admin login
            -admin db
            -reviewer upload and view upload
        -maybe make them all forms and the link into a button without
        styling? I did it with the cancel button and in the original
        Question is if I am going need to to type all that html or if there is a
        shorter way to do it.
        
        -Also comes to the question of it is no problem sending post requests from within the site that I am on.
        
    
    
-HCI, maybe relay this to the original front end only version:
    -Perhaps regular container for larger settings
    and make fixed container for mobile., or at least just for forms.
    
    -....eh, doesn't make a big difference
