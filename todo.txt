-Scripts need redirects.

-All database scripts -> need redirects ?
    -Should I do redirects? This page looks good and functional
    -Registration for event -> donish
    -comments -> donish

-Login scripts, variables passing between pages, perhaps making pages with logins
into php scripts themselves
    -reviewer login
    -admin login
    -reviewer register , must check for same user

-Admin DB page
-security measures on forms

-might want to make anything that needs to check something before entering
into a python page anyway
question is how to link it

    -maybe make them all forms and the link into a button without
    styling? I did it with the cancel button
    Question is if I am going need to to type all that html or if there is a
    shorter way to do it.
