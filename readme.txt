-Django or Flask?
    Django is more of a standard
    Flask is simpler but Django is more advanced. So
	flask may be better for my time frame but learning django would give me a
	headsstart if I am going to use it anyway
    You need sqlalchemy for Flask mysql db
    Bu Django has it built in

	Flask can be learned quickly
